# yelp-dataset-vis

This project is a visualization tool for Yelp Challenge Dataset written in Django and leaflet / d3.

When running the project download yelp challenge dataset from https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset.
The dataset path needs to be added in business/util/constants.py
By default, the path points to ../Data/yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset.
This path should contain all the yelp challange dataset in json format.

This application does not use any database. I'm reading all data into main memory as dictionary.
Hence models.py is my customized class for storing all data from json files.
